# MFA Implementation Report - Updated

## Overview
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) has been successfully implemented in the Celora V2 platform with additional features for mobile optimization and internationalization. This report provides an overview of the complete implementation details and components.

## Database Schema
MFA functionality is supported by the following database schema enhancements:

1. **User Profiles Table Extensions**:
   - `mfa_enabled` (boolean) - Indicates whether MFA is enabled for the user
   - `mfa_secret` (text, encrypted) - The secret key used for TOTP generation
   - `mfa_recovery_codes` (text[], encrypted) - Array of one-time use recovery codes
   - `mfa_last_verified` (timestamp) - Timestamp of last successful MFA verification
   - `mfa_verified_devices` (jsonb) - List of devices that have been verified with MFA
   - `language_preference` (text) - User's preferred language for MFA interfaces

2. **MFA Verification Log Table**:
   - Records all MFA verification attempts (successful and failed)
   - Helps detect brute force attacks and provides audit trail
   - Contains user_id, timestamp, success/failure status, and device information

## Libraries and Tools
The MFA implementation uses the following libraries:

1. **Speakeasy (v2.0.0)**:
   - For TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) generation and verification
   - Compliant with RFC 6238 standards

2. **QRCode (v1.5.3)**:
   - For generating QR codes for authenticator app scanning
   - Provides secure, standardized QR code format

3. **next/navigation**:
   - For device-aware routing between mobile and desktop MFA interfaces
   - Handles redirects based on device type and user preferences

## Components Implemented

### 1. Backend Services
- **auth.ts**:
  - `setupMFA()`: Generates MFA secret and QR code for initial setup
  - `enableMFA()`: Verifies and enables MFA for a user
  - `verifyMFA()`: Verifies TOTP codes during login
  - `verifyRecoveryCode()`: Validates and consumes recovery codes
  - `disableMFA()`: Turns off MFA for a user
  - `isMFAEnabled()`: Checks if MFA is currently enabled
  - `getRemainingRecoveryCodes()`: Lists available recovery codes

### 2. Database Functions
- `generate_recovery_codes()`: Creates cryptographically secure recovery codes
- `verify_recovery_code()`: Validates and consumes a recovery code

### 3. Frontend Components
- **MFASetup.tsx/MfaSetupMobile.tsx**: Multi-step setup wizard for enabling MFA
  - Intro screen with security explanation
  - QR code display and manual key entry option
  - Verification step
  - Recovery code display and storage
  - Mobile-optimized interface with touch-friendly controls

- **MFAVerification.tsx/MfaMobileVerification.tsx**: Verification form shown during login
  - TOTP code input
  - Recovery code alternative
  - "Remember this device" option
  - Session expiration countdown
  - Mobile-optimized interface with segmented input fields

- **MFARecoveryProcess.tsx/MfaRecoveryProcessMobile.tsx**: Interface for recovering access
  - Email verification step
  - Identity verification
  - Recovery request submission
  - Mobile-optimized interfaces with touch-friendly controls

- **MfaDeviceRouter.tsx**: Smart routing between mobile and desktop interfaces
  - Device detection based on user agent and screen size
  - Respects user preferences for interface type
  - Fallback display if routing takes too long

- **LanguageSwitcher.tsx**: Component for changing language preferences
  - Supports multiple display modes (full and minimalist)
  - Persists language selection across sessions

### 4. Cookie/Session Management
- **cookieHelper.ts**:
  - `setMfaPendingCookie()`: Stores MFA verification session
  - `getMfaPendingState()`: Retrieves MFA pending verification
  - `setMfaVerifiedDevice()`: Remembers verified devices
  - `isMfaVerifiedDevice()`: Checks if current device is verified
  - `getCookieValue()`: Gets raw cookie value
  - Multiple utility functions for secure cookie operations

### 5. Internationalization
- **mfaTranslations.ts**:
  - Translation system supporting multiple languages
  - Currently implemented for English and Norwegian
  - Hooks for consuming translations in components
  - Helper functions for language detection

## Mobile Optimization
The MFA implementation includes specific optimizations for mobile devices:

1. **Touch-Friendly Interfaces**:
   - Larger buttons and input fields
   - Wider spacing between interactive elements
   - Touch-optimized segmented input fields for verification codes

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - Adapted layouts for small screens
   - Viewport meta tags to prevent zooming on iOS
   - Safe area insets for modern mobile devices

3. **Device Detection and Routing**:
   - Automatic detection of mobile devices
   - Smart routing between mobile and desktop interfaces
   - User preference override options

## Security Features
1. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks on MFA verification
2. **Secure Storage**: Secrets and recovery codes are encrypted in the database
3. **Device Management**: Option to remember trusted devices
4. **Session Expiry**: MFA verification sessions expire after 5 minutes
5. **Audit Logging**: All verification attempts are logged for security monitoring

## Documentation
- **MFA-README.md**: Comprehensive documentation of the MFA implementation
- **MFA-GUIDE.md**: User-facing documentation for setting up and using MFA
- **README.md**: Updated to include MFA in the platform features

## Testing
Testing scripts have been created to validate all aspects of the MFA implementation:

1. **scripts/test-mfa.js**: Tests core MFA functionality
   - MFA setup process
   - TOTP code verification
   - Recovery code validation
   - Device remembering functionality

2. **scripts/test-mfa-complete.js**: Comprehensive test suite including:
   - Core MFA functionality
   - Mobile-optimized components
   - Internationalization features
   - Device detection and routing

## Conclusion
The MFA implementation provides a robust security enhancement to the Celora V2 platform, following industry best practices for multi-factor authentication. With the addition of mobile optimization and internationalization support, the system delivers a seamless and accessible user experience across all devices and languages. The system is fully functional and ready for production use.
