# Celora V2 Updates - Network Status and Multi-Currency

## Recent Updates

### Network Status and Offline Handling

We've implemented comprehensive network status indicators and WebSocket reconnection functionality to enhance the resilience of the application when network connectivity is intermittent.

**New Components:**
- `NetworkStatusIndicator`: Shows current online/offline status and exchange rate freshness
- `WebSocketReconnector`: Manages WebSocket connections with automatic reconnection

**Documentation:**
- See [NETWORK-STATUS.md](./NETWORK-STATUS.md) for detailed documentation
- Testing instructions available in [test-network-status.md](./test-network-status.md)

### Multi-Currency System Expansion

The multi-currency functionality has been expanded with new UI components and a complete user experience:

**New Components:**
- `CurrencySwitcher`: Allows users to switch between currencies with different display variants
- `CurrencyFormatter`: Components for displaying and converting currency amounts
- `useCurrencyPreferences`: Hook for managing user currency preferences

**Database Updates:**
- Schema updated with multi-currency tables, indexes, and policies
- Feature flags added for controlling multi-currency features

**Demo Pages:**
- `/demo/network-status`: Shows network status indicators and multi-currency components
- `/demo/multi-currency`: Dedicated page for multi-currency features

## Testing

The new functionality can be tested using:
1. The demo pages at `/demo/network-status` and `/demo/multi-currency`
2. Chrome DevTools Network tab to simulate offline/online state
3. The testing instructions in [test-network-status.md](./test-network-status.md)

## Next Steps

- Implement admin controls for exchange rate sources
- Add more granular offline detection for API endpoints
- Enhance WebSocket security for real-time rate updates
- Integrate with transaction history for currency conversion tracking
