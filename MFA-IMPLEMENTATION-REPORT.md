# MFA Implementation Report

## Overview
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) has been successfully implemented in the Celora V2 platform. This report provides an overview of the implementation details and components.

## Database Schema
MFA functionality is supported by the following database schema enhancements:

1. **User Profiles Table Extensions**:
   - `mfa_enabled` (boolean) - Indicates whether MFA is enabled for the user
   - `mfa_secret` (text, encrypted) - The secret key used for TOTP generation
   - `mfa_recovery_codes` (text[], encrypted) - Array of one-time use recovery codes
   - `mfa_last_verified` (timestamp) - Timestamp of last successful MFA verification
   - `mfa_verified_devices` (jsonb) - List of devices that have been verified with MFA

2. **MFA Verification Log Table**:
   - Records all MFA verification attempts (successful and failed)
   - Helps detect brute force attacks and provides audit trail
   - Contains user_id, timestamp, success/failure status, and device information

## Libraries and Tools
The MFA implementation uses the following libraries:

1. **Speakeasy (v2.0.0)**:
   - For TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) generation and verification
   - Compliant with RFC 6238 standards

2. **QRCode (v1.5.3)**:
   - For generating QR codes for authenticator app scanning
   - Provides secure, standardized QR code format

## Components Implemented

### 1. Backend Services
- **auth.ts**:
  - `setupMFA()`: Generates MFA secret and QR code for initial setup
  - `enableMFA()`: Verifies and enables MFA for a user
  - `verifyMFA()`: Verifies TOTP codes during login
  - `verifyRecoveryCode()`: Validates and consumes recovery codes
  - `disableMFA()`: Turns off MFA for a user
  - `isMFAEnabled()`: Checks if MFA is currently enabled
  - `getRemainingRecoveryCodes()`: Lists available recovery codes

### 2. Database Functions
- `generate_recovery_codes()`: Creates cryptographically secure recovery codes
- `verify_recovery_code()`: Validates and consumes a recovery code

### 3. Frontend Components
- **MFASetup.tsx**: Multi-step setup wizard for enabling MFA
  - Intro screen with security explanation
  - QR code display and manual key entry option
  - Verification step
  - Recovery code display and storage

- **MFAVerification.tsx**: Verification form shown during login
  - TOTP code input
  - Recovery code alternative
  - "Remember this device" option
  - Session expiration countdown

- **MFASettings.tsx**: Management interface in user settings
  - MFA status display
  - Enable/disable controls
  - Recovery code management

### 4. Cookie/Session Management
- **cookieHelper.ts**:
  - `setMfaPendingCookie()`: Stores MFA verification session
  - `getMfaPendingState()`: Retrieves MFA pending verification
  - `setMfaVerifiedDevice()`: Remembers verified devices
  - `isMfaVerifiedDevice()`: Checks if current device is verified

## Security Features
1. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks on MFA verification
2. **Secure Storage**: Secrets and recovery codes are encrypted in the database
3. **Device Management**: Option to remember trusted devices
4. **Session Expiry**: MFA verification sessions expire after 5 minutes
5. **Audit Logging**: All verification attempts are logged for security monitoring

## Documentation
- **MFA-GUIDE.md**: User-facing documentation for setting up and using MFA
- **README.md**: Updated to include MFA in the platform features
- **check-mfa.ps1**: Script for verifying MFA database setup

## Testing
A test script has been created in `scripts/test-mfa.js` that validates:
1. MFA setup process
2. TOTP code verification
3. Recovery code validation
4. Device remembering functionality

## Conclusion
The MFA implementation provides a robust security enhancement to the Celora V2 platform, following industry best practices for multi-factor authentication. The system is fully functional and ready for production use.
