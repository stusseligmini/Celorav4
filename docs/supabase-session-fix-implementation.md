# Supabase Session Flapping Fix - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of fixes for the Supabase session instability ("flapping") issue. The problem was causing unexpected logouts, JSON parsing errors, and WebSocket connection failures due to multiple Supabase client instances and corrupted storage data.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Browser Client Singleton Pattern

**File:** `src/lib/supabase-browser.ts`

We implemented a singleton pattern for the Supabase browser client to ensure that only one instance exists per browser context with the same storage key. This prevents conflicts between multiple client instances trying to read/write to the same storage location.

```typescript
let browserClient: ReturnType<typeof createClient<any>> | null = null;
export function getBrowserClient() {
  if (!browserClient) {
    browserClient = createClient(url, anon, {
      auth: { storageKey: "sb-zpcycakwdvymqhwvakrv-auth", ... }
    });
  }
  return browserClient;
}
```

### 2. Storage Cleanup Functionality

**Files:** 
- `src/lib/supabaseCleanup.ts`
- `src/lib/cookieHelper.ts`

We created comprehensive cleanup functionality to remove corrupted Supabase-related data from localStorage and cookies. This runs early in the application lifecycle to ensure a clean state before the Supabase client initializes.

The cleanup function can operate in two modes:
- Remove only problematic/corrupted data (`forceClean=false`)
- Remove all Supabase-related data (`forceClean=true`) for a complete reset

### 3. Early Initialization Component

**File:** `src/app/supabase-init.tsx`

We added a new component that runs the storage cleanup function as early as possible in the application lifecycle. This component is included in the root layout file.

```typescript
export function SupabaseInitializer() {
  useEffect(() => {
    cleanupSupabaseStorage();
  }, []);
  return null;
}
```

### 4. Updated Provider Component

**File:** `src/providers/SupabaseProvider.tsx`

The SupabaseProvider has been updated to use the singleton browser client and incorporate the cleanup functionality. It now includes better error handling and recovery mechanisms.

### 5. Updated Auth Hook

**File:** `src/hooks/useAuthFlow.ts`

The authentication hook has been updated to use the singleton browser client, which ensures consistent authentication state across the application.

## Testing

After implementing these changes, please verify the following:

1. **Authentication Flow**: Ensure users can log in and out without unexpected session terminations
2. **Session Persistence**: Verify that users stay logged in when refreshing the page
3. **Realtime Functionality**: Check that realtime subscriptions work correctly
4. **Multiple Tabs**: Test the behavior when multiple tabs are open

## Technical Details

### Storage Key

The singleton implementation uses a fixed storage key (`sb-zpcycakwdvymqhwvakrv-auth`) to ensure consistency. This key matches what was previously used in the application.

### Cleanup Logic

The cleanup process:
1. Scans localStorage for Supabase-related keys (prefixed with `sb-` or containing `supabase`)
2. Identifies problematic entries (base64-encoded, extremely long, or malformed)
3. Removes identified entries
4. Performs similar scanning and removal for cookies
5. Logs the cleanup activities for debugging purposes

### Error Recovery

The implementation includes several error recovery mechanisms:
- Automatic retry logic for failed operations
- Session refreshing when inconsistencies are detected
- WebSocket connection monitoring

## Next Steps

1. **Monitoring**: Watch for any recurrence of the issue in production
2. **Performance Analysis**: Ensure the cleanup process doesn't impact application startup time
3. **Refinement**: Fine-tune the cleanup parameters based on production data

## Conclusion

By implementing a proper singleton pattern for the Supabase client and adding comprehensive storage cleanup, we've addressed the root causes of the session flapping issue. The solution is robust yet minimally invasive, focusing on the specific problematic areas without requiring a complete refactor of the authentication system.
