## 📁 ROOT LEVEL ANALYSIS

### 🔴 IMMEDIATE REMOVAL CANDIDATES (Environment Files)
**Problem**: 7+ different environment configurations creating confusion and security risks

| File | Status | Reason |
|------|--------|---------|
| `.env` | 🔴 DELETE | Contains actual secrets - SECURITY RISK |
| `.env.development` | 🔴 DELETE | Duplicate of local config |
| `.env.local.example` | 🔴 DELETE | Duplicate of .env.example |
| `.env.production` | 🔴 DELETE | Contains production secrets - SECURITY RISK |
| `.env.production.custom-domain` | 🔴 DELETE | Specific config that should be in Vercel |
| `.env.production.template` | 🔴 DELETE | Duplicate template |
| `.env.staging` | 🔴 DELETE | Unused staging config |
| `.env.local` | 🔴 DELETE | Local secrets file |

**Keep Only**: `.env.example` (sanitized template)

├── components/ ✅
├── hooks/ ✅
├── lib/ ✅
├── providers/ ✅
├── server/ ✅
└── types/ ✅
```

### 🔴 SCATTERED COMPONENTS/HOOKS

| Location | Status | Action |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/components/` (root) | 🔴 MOVE | Move to src/components/ |
| `/hooks/` (root) | 🔴 MOVE | Move to src/hooks/ |

## 🎯 CONSOLIDATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Environment Cleanup
```bash
# Keep only sanitized template
rm .env .env.development .env.local* .env.production* .env.staging
# Review and sanitize .env.example
```

### Phase 2: Documentation Consolidation
```bash
# Create new consolidated docs
mkdir -p docs/operations/
mkdir -p docs/deployment/

# Consolidate into:
# - docs/deployment/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md
# - docs/operations/MONITORING.md  
# - docs/operations/ROLLBACK.md
```

### Phase 3: Database Schema Cleanup
```bash
# Keep only master schemas
cd database/
rm *-step*.sql solana-missing-tables-only.sql wallet-schema.sql
# Review feature/MFA/notification schemas for integration
```

### Phase 4: Structure Optimization
```bash
# Move scattered files to proper locations
mv /components/* src/components/
mv /hooks/* src/hooks/
mv /services/* src/lib/services/
mv *.sql database/
mv *.js scripts/
```

## ⚠️ SECURITY RISKS TO ADDRESS IMMEDIATELY

1. **🚨 CRITICAL**: Remove all `.env*` files with actual secrets
2. **🚨 HIGH**: Remove `production-keys.txt` 
3. **🚨 HIGH**: Review any hardcoded secrets in config files
4. **🚨 MEDIUM**: Consolidate database schemas to prevent conflicts

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1. **AWAIT USER CONFIRMATION** before any deletions
2. Create backup of current state
3. Execute safe cleanup operations
4. Restructure remaining files
5. Update configuration files
6. Validate build and functionality
7. Generate final structure report

**⚠️ WARNING**: This audit identified significant security risks with exposed environment files. Address immediately before any deployment.
